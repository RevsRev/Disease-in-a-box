# Disease-in-a-box
A toy model for how a disease can spread, and how certain factors influence this spread.

Compile all the java files in the same directory. Compile them in the following order:

1. All rows (LiveDataRow.java, SetupRow.java, SetupRowAlt.java)
2. DynamicsPanel.java, StaticsPanel.java, LiveDataPanel.java
3. SimulationControlPanel.java
4. Person.java
5. SimulationWindow.java
6. Simulation.java

Then typing java Simulation will run the compiled Simulation.java class, which starts the simulation.

Two windows will open - one displays the disease spreading in a box and the other is a control panel for modifying the parameters of the simulation.
